# üéØ Prosora Personalization & Control System Design

## üß† **Current 5-Phase System Analysis**

### **Phase 1: Basic Intelligence** (Foundation)
- **What it does**: Core content aggregation and basic AI analysis
- **User Controls Needed**: Source selection, content types, basic filters

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Intelligence** (Real Sources)
- **What it does**: Integrates real RSS feeds, web scraping, evidence gathering
- **User Controls Needed**: Source priority, freshness weights, credibility thresholds

### **Phase 3: Personalized Intelligence** (Voice & Style)
- **What it does**: Applies personal voice, frameworks, writing style
- **User Controls Needed**: Voice profiles, framework selection, tone adjustments

### **Phase 4: Optimized Intelligence** (A/B Testing)
- **What it does**: Creates content variants, predicts engagement, optimizes performance
- **User Controls Needed**: Variant preferences, testing strategies, optimization goals

### **Phase 5: Self-Improving Intelligence** (Learning Loop)
- **What it does**: Learns from performance, adapts strategies, improves over time
- **User Controls Needed**: Learning preferences, feedback integration, adaptation speed

## üîß **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Frontend Controls Architecture**
```python
# Modular control system
class PersonalizationControls:
    - VoiceStyleSelector()
    - SourcePriorityManager()
    - ContentOptimizationSettings()
    - LearningPreferences()
    - PerformanceTracking()
```

### **Backend Configuration Management**
```python
# User configuration persistence
class UserConfigManager:
    - save_profile()
    - load_profile()
    - merge_configurations()
    - validate_settings()
